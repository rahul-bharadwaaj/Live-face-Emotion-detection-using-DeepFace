# Live-face-Emotion-detection-using-DeepFace
Detect the face emotion in realtime
Covering face immersion recognition and as a programming language we will use python.
For loading an image and overlaying this rectangle and this text data we will use **opencv(pip install opencv-python)**
For face emotion recognition we will not train the data set rather we can use a pre-trained deep learning library which is **deep face** it contains a lot of pre-trained deep learning  architectures for face emotion recognition. One extra feature of deep face is that not only it specify the emotion of aface rather it can detect the age of a person or a race of a person.
Used **"Haar Cascade"** which is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.
